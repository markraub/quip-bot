# quip-bot
A hot mess of trash that I'm slowly forming into a twitter game-show bot. 

## Gameplay
At the top of every half hour (0:00/0:30 for dummies) this bot will tweet a prompt akin to a quiplash prompt, and the most liked reply within the first 15 minutes gets the retweet. 
(Social media follows are currency, society is dying, existence is meaningless, you get the point)

## How it done
Tracery, and my god given american freedom
